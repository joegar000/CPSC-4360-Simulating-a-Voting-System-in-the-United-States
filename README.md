**DESCRIPTION**

This software emulates the voting system and election process within the United States, it models a straight ballot voting system (used in real life by some states). The user can log in to the software as a voter, a poll worker, an administrator, a person of the press, or an electorate. Each log in comes with different options based on what options are likely available to those actors in real life. The voter has access to a list of candidates and can cast votes for their desired party. The poll worker can register a voter and add them to the database, display a voter's information, and display a list of the candidates. The administrator can register voters, poll workers, administrators, and candidates and add them to their respective databases. They can also validate votes, display a list of all the voters in the voter database, display a  list of all the candidates in the candidate database, and they can display a list of the candidate results. The electorates can look at the candidate results and announce the winners. The press can look at the candidate results.


**RUNNING THE SOURCE CODE**

In order to run the source code, JDBC, sqlite, and JavaFX must be installed on the code editor.

To install sqlite, follow this article: https://www.infoworld.com/article/3388036/what-is-jdbc-introduction-to-java-database-connectivity.html. The sqlite JDBC library must be referenced.

To install JavaFX on VSCode follow this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H67COH9F718. It demonstrates how to set the classpath for JavaFX and how to install the JavaFX libraries.
